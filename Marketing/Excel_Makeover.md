I often hear podcasters jest about the #1 programming language in business is Excel. I tend to agree and add that it is indeed the right tool for the job in so many instances.

 

In fact it is hard to beat...

- Nearly ubiquitous in business settings, 
- It combines data exploration, manipulation, and reporting in one place.
- It is fast to develop, fast to deploy

... That is, until they end up being a drag

 

I have seen many fantastic reports, loved by management, become a part of the standard reporting cycle. And many of these reports end up being dreaded by their creator (myself included) because of the effort required to continually update and distribute them.

 Most of what I see are really good first drafts. Something that was designed to answer a one-time question that evolved into being a staple for the business. With a good enough mentality the workbook was never revised to be the robust final draft production version.

 As these reports build up over time they end up becoming a drain on company resources. A weekly report that takes an hour to pull together costs the company over a week of yearly productivity. This equates to 2.5% of a single persons yearly productivity . . . for just one report.

 Most companies have someone(s) that is the go-to Excel person. They have enough skill to surface insights from the data. They are good at formulas, can do some analysis, and maybe they know pivot tables. However, even good Excel users are not aware or don't understand how to apply the built in features to transform it into a true production ready report. 

 The main reason for this is the creator is someone with domain expertise other than reporting and analytics. Whether that be in finance, sales, marketing or anything else. Creating the production version of the report requires an approach much like a software developer. A developer mindset considers questions related to user experience, maintainability, distribution, security, and automation. While it not a monumental leap for domain workers to design for these considerations, in practice this is rarely done.

 The **Excel Makeover** is that pivotal last step to transform an Excel workbook to an enterprise grade tool. 

- Bullet proof its design
- Provide confidence in its accuracy
- Ensure cost efficenciy in its maintenance
- Simplify maintenance for administrative delegation
- Document the workbook providing resiliency beyond its creator

 

 

# Makeover need indicators:

- Any workbook that takes longer than 5-10 minutes to update
- Have multiple versions of the same report for different people
- Report would be at jeopardy if person maintaining terminates
- New data is copied into the report instead of using Power Query
- "Formula's almost work, so we just type over the ones that don't"
- Reports are emailed instead of shared
- Anything is done manually in the workbook, because almost everything can be automated
- The person maintaining the workbook is not the person who designed it
- The report was designed more than two years ago, Excel has added so many features since then
- Reports are crucial for operations management
- Wish there was a way to calculate YTD Growth (There is!)
- Wish the report could just do more
- =IF(IF(IF(IF(IF("This look familiar")))))

# Cornerstones of the methodology:

 

|              |                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Best Fit:    | Right tools for  the right staff<br /><br />Does organization  have resources to move some of the heavy lifting out of Excel?   For many small  companies the answer is no and Excel is probably the best place to keep that  data. It requires no additional  infrastructure or cost and can be maintained by the power users creating the  reports today. <br /><br />If the company has  a full time infotech, database admin or software developer, it may  have the means to support a centralized data model to pull this work out of  Excel.  It is usually better to have  data governance and transformations handled by a specialist, freeing front  line workers to use the data rather than maintaining it. |
| Automate:    | Let the computer  do it's own work.<br /><br />Especially for  data flows and transformations. This  is usually the bulk of the manual work being done to generate an Excel report  and gives immediate savings in employee time.<br /><br />The best thing  about computers is they do exactly what they are told do and do it exactly  the same every time. Excel has  powerful automation tools to query and transform data even before the first  formula is written.<br /><br />If the data  generation from its source can also be automated as well, this means the report can be  entirely automated from end to end.   Just open, refresh and enjoy. |
| Accuracy:    | Simple, readable  and reliable.<br /><br />Often times  accuracy and reliability are a function of simplicity. Generally the simplest approach is going to  be the most accurate and reliable over time.   Unfortunately, Excel make this difficult by giving multiple ways to  solve any problem but it also provides some tools to make even complex logic  more user friendly.<br /><br />The approach to  accuracy always includes:<br />- Audit all formulas and make sure they do what they are supposed to do<br />- Simplify formulas so they are easier to understand (and maintain)<br />- Implement human readable structured references<br />- Protect functionality to prevent accidental changes<br />- Implement Data validation on inputs<br />- Take any complexity out of day to day maintenance |
| Resiliency:  | Reports that grow  with the business and its employees<br /><br />Reports end up  being critical to operations but never receive proper documentation to ensure  business resiliency. When  responsibility for maintaining the workbook is transitioned between  employees, the formulas and logic for the reports can be lost.<br /><br />Resiliency is  coupled with the simplicity and accuracy but also incorporates design  strategies that don't break when the report needs updated.  It also requires the necessary documentation to update its design or trouble shoot issues in the future. |
| Efficient:   | What can't be automated must be efficient<br /><br />Fortunately, efficiency is usually a byproduct of making the workbook accurate and resilient but sometimes there can be few things left beyond the skills of a novice Excel user.  A final pass is  made to clean up any remaining complexities and provide a report that can  truly be maintained by anyone.<br /><br />What  this means (depending on confidentiality of the data) is creating a report  that be managed by administrative positions with minimal Excel skills. Freeing knowledge workers completely from  their mundane reporting tasks. |
| Extrapolate: | Ask more questions that  the data can answer<br /><br />Yes the report was made to show what to order. Does it also answer if too much was ordered, when to adjust min and max levels,  suggest  possible volume discount opportunities and calculate landed cost?<br /><br />By maintaining a  single data set designed to answer more than question can eliminate redundant  reports save time and simplify decision making. |
|              |                                                              |
