 A complementary analysis and recommendations on how to improve any single Excel spreadsheet or report for your organization.  

What better way to demonstrate value than produce something you can take with you and use. 

In fact: the demo is simply a limited version of the full  <Excel Makeover>

Recommendations could include a new working prototype Excel workbook**.



------

We could always just setup a demo to review some generic content but the hands-on approach provides value for all in the process.

 

- Time spent reviewing our service is paid back in time savings for your report
- The concepts themselves are simple but the leap is understanding when and how to apply them.  Seeing the transformation on your own report helps everything come together and provide learning that is transferable to other processes that need to be improved.
- The process provides insight into your business, your data, reporting proficiency, and the right size approach for your organization

 

#### Go Ahead and bring the nasty

We welcome the most tedious, time consuming report you have. There is almost certainly some small things that can done to make the process much better. 

 Please reach out to schedule an analysis by emailing refresh@ProcessInsightFuture.com

#### ** the fine print

 

Total consulting time for the review is limited to 4 hours. Depending on the breadth and depth of the workbook could range from a few improvements to a complete solution.

There are a number of ways to structure the collaborations based upon your technology, security and privacy concerns. A few possibilities are outlined below but open to any way that makes sense for your business.

No solution is bulletproof, adhering to good design practices will help protect workbooks from breaking. However every solution may eventually break. Learn the concepts and how they are implemented so you can maintain in the future. This free consultation does not include any continuing warranties or guarantees for maintaining proposed solutions into the future.

# Review options:

 

### Good: 2 hours Live Webinar

** For local clients, this could also be done in person.

# Privacy and Security:

 

We treat any client data stored on our infrastructure with sensitivity. All data is protected, restricted, treated as confidential and destroyed upon completion.  We always prefer to collaborate in a method that keeps data and its security in the hands of the client.

 Client Data is always:

- Only stored in systems requiring two factor authentication

- Separated from reporting layer when possible

- Not included in backup system

- Sampled and obfuscated if needed for continued development

- Destroyed once no longer needed in the development process


 Because of the potential sensitivity of the review process, we will need authorization from an officer at the company before scheduling the review.

 Non-Disclosure Agreements(NDA's) are available upon request. We will gladly sign any NDA's as required by your organization.
