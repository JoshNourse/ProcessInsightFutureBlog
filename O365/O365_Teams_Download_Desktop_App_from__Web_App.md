# Download Microsoft Teams Desktop App from the Teams Web App

 

My preferred method to recommend downloading the Teams desktop app is to have then down load it by first logging into the Teams Web app.

 

While there are other methods (Such as this direct download link)...

### ... by first having them access Teams online verifies:

 

1. Verify if they have a valid Office 365 Business account

   - Not a requirement: regular Microsoft accounts (or third party accounts) can be added to      Teams as guests. But helpful to      know what kind of account you are inviting.
   - If this download procedure      does not work, it will probably generate a question which will help you      understand the account you are trying to invite a little better.

2. User know their user name and     password

   - This can be      accessed if saved in the browser (Link how to access stored credentials)

3. User knows how to access     Office on the Web

   - as an alternative      method, a mobile method
   - Means to give presentation      on conference computer without transferring files or hooking in personal      laptop
   - As a way to access more than      one primary office tenant at the same time
